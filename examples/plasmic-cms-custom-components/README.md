# Plasmic CMS custom components example

This is a demo of how to write your own custom code components that lets users pick content entries from the Plasmic CMS and display that content.

- We use usePlasmicDataQuery for pre-rendering SSG/SSR support.
- While in Studio, we also list all available content entries so that users can pick in the sidebar.

You can also use the basic built-in Plasmic CMS components here:
